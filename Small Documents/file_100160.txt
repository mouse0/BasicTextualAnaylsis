 shown by both indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis, using polyclonal antibodies to synthetic gL peptides indicated that the baculovirus expressed gL was abundant on the surface of baculovirus gL infected Sf9 cells. A  small fraction of the 31 kDa polypeptide was secreted into the extracellular medium as judged by Western blot analysis. The secreted form of gL was completely resistant to Endoglycosidase H (Endo-H), while the membrane associated form of gL was only partially resistant to Endo-H treatment, suggesting that the secreted gL represented a subpopulation of the membrane bound gL. Mice vaccinated with baculovirus expressed gL produced serum antibodies that reacted with authentic HSV-1 gL. However, these mice produced no HSV-1 neutralizing antibody (titer <
