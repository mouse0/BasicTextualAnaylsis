 Gremiakova TA, Stepanshina VN, Korobova OV, Anisimov GA.  Protective properties of the recombinant strain Salmonella minnesota R595/GSA in  experimental murine plague were studied. The recombinant vaccine ReFI possesses a high protective activity against plague with the level of survival, the LD50, indexes of immunity and the mean periods of animal death not inferior to those of the commercial vaccine. The protective properties of the live and killed recombinant ReFI vaccines in experimental murine plague are practically identical. The experimental recombinant vaccine is efficient at infecting doses up to 10(5) CFU. The live and killed vaccines are nontoxic for mice at doses up
