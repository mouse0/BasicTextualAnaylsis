 acid fragment of CAP-18. Synthetic peptide #197 (identical sequence to CAP-7, Gly1-Try37) and #36-1 (a truncation of CAP consisting of 32 amino acid residues,  Gly1-Ala32) showed LPS-binding activity. Each peptide inhibited LPS-induced tissue factor(TF) generation by murine peritoneal macrophages, even added 1-3 hours after stimulation of cells with LPS. C57BL/6 mice treated with #197 were significantly protected from lethal LPS challenge. Peptide #36 also blocked the LPS-induced lethality. These peptides had antibacterial activity to gram-negative bacteria, such as E.coli, S.typhimurium, K.pneumonia, Ps.aeruginosa and also to gram-positive S.aureus (Methicillin sensitive and resistant strains). Both peptides inhibited TF- and Xa-induced plasma clotting. Using synthetic
