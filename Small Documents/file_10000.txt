The Saccharomyces cerevisiae NatB N-terminal acetylase contains a catalytic subunit Naa20 and an auxiliary subunit Naa25. To elucidate the cellular functions of the NatB, we utilized the Synthetic Genetic Array to screen for genes that are essential for cell growth in the absence of NAA20. The genome-wide synthetic lethal screen of NAA20 identified genes encoding for serine/threonine protein kinase Vps15, 1,3-beta-glucanosyltransferase Gas5, and a catabolic repression
