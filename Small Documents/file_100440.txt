 completely protected and no tumors were observed. This is despite the fact that little or no SV40 T-ag-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity was detectable. In contrast, only 3 of 10 mice immunized with anti-Id 58D were protected from a lethal challenge. These results indicate that, although monoclonal anti-Id immunization can induce responses that recognize similar SV40 T-ag epitopes and express shared idiotopes associated with antibodies to SV40 T-ag, the recombinant antigen itself induces superior in vivo tumor immunity.
