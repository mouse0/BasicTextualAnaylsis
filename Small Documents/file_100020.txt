 simultaneous presence of null alleles both URA7 and URA8 is lethal. Based on the  codon bias values for the two genes and the intracellular concentrations of CTP in strains deleted for one of the two genes, relative to the wild-type level, URA7 appears to be the major gene for CTP biosynthesis. Nevertheless, URA8 alone  also allows yeast growth, at least under standard laboratory conditions.  PMID: 8121398  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]   2808. Eur J Biochem. 1994 Feb 1;219(3):737-42.
