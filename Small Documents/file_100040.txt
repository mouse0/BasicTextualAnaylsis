 Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 lipid A, characterized by beta-(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide 1-phosphate, with one hydroxyacyl group and one acyloxyacl group, i.e., 3-hydroxy-15-methyl-hexadecanoyl and 3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl groups at the 2 and 2' positions, respectively, was less endotoxically active than the synthetic Escherichia-coli-type lipid A (compound 506), which possesses beta-(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide 1,4'-bisphosphate, with two acyloxyacyl groups at the 2' and 3' positions and two 3-hydroxytetradecanoyl group at the 2 and 3 positions and the synthetic Salmonella-type lipid A (compound 516), which has three acyloxyacyl groups at the 2,2' and 3' positions and one hydroxyacyl group at the
