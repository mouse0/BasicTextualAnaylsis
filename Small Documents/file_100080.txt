 inserted epitopes and assembled into empty capsids. Immunoelectron microscopy indicated that the epitopes inserted in the loop were exposed on the surface of the chimeric particles. The chimeric capsids were immunogenic in mice and antibodies specific for the inserted sequences were induced. In the case of MHV,  antibodies were produced that recognized the epitope in the context of native virus. Mice immunized with the chimeric capsids were partially protected against  a lethal challenge infection with either MHV or HSV.  PMID: 7507280  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]
