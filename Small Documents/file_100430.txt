 lethal dose of SV40-transformed cells to assess in vivo tumor immunity. Two biweekly immunization with either SV40 T-ag or anti-Id 58D induced humoral responses that recognized both SV40 T-ag and anti-Id 58D. Four biweekly immunizations with SV40 T-ag increased the antigen-specific antibody titers and decreased the response to anti-Id 58D, while four biweekly immunizations of anti-Id 58D increased antibody titers to both itself and SV40 T-ag. Comparison of specific T-ag epitope and idiotope specificities indicated that SV40 T-ag and anti-Id 58D immunization generated responses that recognized a similar epitope on SV40 T-ag and expressed a shared idiotope recognized by anti-Id 58D. SV40 T-ag immunized mice challenged with a lethal dose of SV40-transformed cells were
