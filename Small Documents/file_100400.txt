 more abundant in dedifferentiating tissue than in pith. The subtractive library contains approximately seven major species, two of which, NGSUB7 and NGSUB8, are  highly abundant. In Northern blots, these two hybridized to mRNA species whose abundance increased significantly but transiently during the first 4 to 8 h of culture. The sequence of NGSUB7 showed no significant homology at a nucleotide or derived amino acid level with any previously reported sequence. NGSUB8 however, showed significant homology over part of the derived amino acid sequence to several yeast and bacterial proteins with DNA binding function. We propose that the two recombinants represent transcripts from two novel genes edeA and edeB, which are expressed early in dedifferentiation.
