In the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, CTP synthetase catalyses the conversion of uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP) to cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP). In the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the URA7 gene encoding this enzyme was previously shown to be nonessential for cell viability. The present paper describes the selection  of synthetic lethal mutants in the CTP biosynthetic pathway that led us to clone  a second gene, named URA8, which also encodes a CTP synthetase. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of the products of URA7 and URA8 shows 78% identity. Deletion of the URA8 gene is viable in a haploid strain but
