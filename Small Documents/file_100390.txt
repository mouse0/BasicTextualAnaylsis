Pith explants of Nicotiana glauca grown in vitro in synthetic medium supplemented with 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 D), are induced to dedifferentiate. Treatment with actinomycin D within the first 4-8 h of culture (but not later) is lethal and the explants die, implying a requirement for de novo transcription. The genes expressed during the initial period of culture are presumably critical  for subsequent cell survival and proliferation, but so far their identity is unknown. We have constructed a subtractive cDNA library, enriched in sequences
