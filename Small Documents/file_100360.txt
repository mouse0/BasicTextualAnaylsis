  BACKGROUND: The various conservative measures which have been used to date in the treatment of acute pancreatitis have not proven helpful. However, somatostatin appears to have a favourable effect on the course and outcome of this potentially lethal disease. METHOD AND RESULTS: Experiments in animals have shown that somatostatin prevents  experimentally induced acute pancreatitis and lowers the mortality rate of established pancreatitis. In human acute pancreatitis, somatostatin reduces gastric and pancreatic secretions; it reduces the local complication rate and shortens hospitalization. The effect of somatostatin on the mortality rate of
