 final survival outcome after challenge with 2 x 10(3) pfu of Pichinde virus. This protection was not complete compared to priming with Pichinde virus in the footpad, which was not lethal and provided 100% protection. At a higher challenge dose of Pichinde virus, 2 x 10(4) pfu, immunization with VVNP51-561 delayed mortality but did not increase final survival. The partial protection correlated  with an early but not late reduction in infectious virus in serum, kidney and liver, and infectious centers in the spleen. Thus the immune response generated by VVNP51-561 could initially control the infection, effectively reducing the virus inoculum. As the infection proceeded, virus replication could not be limited resulting in death in some hamsters. The partial protection did not
