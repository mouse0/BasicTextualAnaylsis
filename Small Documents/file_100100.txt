  Injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into experimental animals induces septic shock associated with the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and platelet-activating factor (PAF). Because both TNF and PAF stimulate neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells in vitro, and because neutrophils are important effector cells in sepsis-induced lung vascular injury, the role of TNF and PAF in LPS-induced lung neutrophil sequestration was investigated. Lung myeloperoxidase  (MPO) activity was measured as a quantitative assessment of pulmonary leukostasis. Injection of Salmonella enteritidis LPS into rats caused dose-dependent increases in lung MPO that peaked at 2 hours and persisted for up
