 to 24 hours. Injection of purified human recombinant TNF (2 to 200 micrograms/kg  i.v.) mimicked the effect of LPS on lung MPO activity. Injection of synthetic PAF increased lung MPO only at the highest and lethal dose (10 micrograms/kg). Lower  doses (0.1 and 1 microgram/kg) of PAF had no effect on lung MPO by itself and did not enhance LPS- or TNF-induced lung neutrophil sequestration. Furthermore, pretreatment of the rats with two different PAF receptor-antagonists, WEB 2086 (10 mg/kg IP) and SRI 63-441 (10 mg/kg IP), failed to block LPS-induced (1 mg/kg) increase in lung MPO. These data suggest that TNF, not PAF, mediates LPS-induced  pulmonary neutrophil sequestration in the intact rat.
