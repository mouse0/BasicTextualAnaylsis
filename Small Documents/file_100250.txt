Endotoxin(lipopolysaccharide = LPS), cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria, activates monocytes and macrophages to release cytokines, reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI), and to generate tissue factor(TF) which initiate coagulation. We have purified 7kDa and 18kDa cationic antibacterial proteins (CAP-7 and CAP-18) with LPS-binding and LPS-neutralizing activities from rabbit granulocytes using as an assay the agglutination of erythrocytes coated with Re-LPS. From protein sequencing, CAP-7 was identified as the C-terminal 37 amino
