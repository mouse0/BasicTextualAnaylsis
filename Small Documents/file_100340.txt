 were similar. Both intracellular and extracellular D2E delta 102 induced neutralizing antibodies in mice and were thus immunogenic. The level of protective immunity to DEN-2 virus encephalitis challenge in mice vaccinated with intracellular D2E delta 102 (80%, p < 0.01) was lower than that induced with D2E  delta 71 (90%, P < 0.001). Sixty-eight percent (P < 0.001) of mice vaccinated with 5 micrograms of extracellular D2E delta 102 protein were protected against lethal challenge.  PMID: 7826210  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]
