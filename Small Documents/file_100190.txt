 ischemic models in gerbils and rats are based on the protection afforded against  the lethal effects of global ischemia. HU-211 gave over 30% protection, by i.v. administration. The optimal dose ranges of HU-211 were between 5 and 10 mg/kg i.v. In gerbils we used a transient ischemia model induced by occlusion (10 min)  of the bilateral common carotid arteries (BCCA). HU-211, 8 mg/kg i.v., gave a significantly (p < or = 0.05) better in vivo performed than a control group over  three days following ischemia. Histology performed in gerbil model also resulted  in significantly (p < 0.001) diminished degeneration area of CA1 in the hippocampus after treatment of HU-211. In the rat model, after four vessel occlusion (4VO) (20 min), HU-211 treatment significantly (p < 0.01) improved
