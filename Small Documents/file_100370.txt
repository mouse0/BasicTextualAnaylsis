 acute pancreatitis has not been demonstrated in isolated studies, although a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials has shown a mortality rate of 6.2%  in the somatostatin treated group versus 14.0% in the placebo-treated group. The  synthetic analogue of somatostatin, octreotide, is an effective treatment for established local complication of acute pancreatitis, such as pancreatic fistulae and pseudocysts. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that large-scale, carefully designed multi-centre studies of somatostatin are needed if the beneficial effects of this drug on the  course and outcome of acute pancreatitis are to be evaluated.
