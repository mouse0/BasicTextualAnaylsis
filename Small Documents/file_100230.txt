 There was up to one log reduction in serum antibody titers after immunization without using any adjuvant or using Freund's incomplete adjuvant, and up to two logs following oral immunization. Immunization by oral feeding of the vaccine followed by RITARD challenge with a virulent V. cholerae O1 strain showed evidence of protection against severe or lethal diarrhea. The results suggest that the vaccine retains its antigen content and ability to induce antibodies unchanged when maintained at elevated temperatures for relatively long periods of time.
