Syrian hamsters, strain MHA/Lak, are susceptible to intraperitoneal infection with Pichinde virus and die from an overwhelming viremia. We have studied the ability of a vaccinia-Pichinde recombinant virus expressing amino acids 51-561 of the viral nucleoprotein (VVNP51-561) to protect from lethal Pichinde virus infection. Priming with VVNP51-561 significantly delayed mortality and increased
