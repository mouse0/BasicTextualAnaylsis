We have constructed a recombinant baculovirus expressing high levels of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein L (gL) in Sf9 cells. Sf9 cells infected with this recombinant virus synthesized three polypeptides of 26-27 kDa  28 kDa, and 31 kDa. The 28 and 31 kDa species were sensitive to tunicamycin and N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) treatment, suggesting that they were glycosylated. As
