 containing 1 mg of B-subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) produced by recombinant DNA technology (the WC/rCTB vaccine) was subjected to temperatures of 4 C, 30 C or 42 C for up to 6 months time. Lipopolysaccharide antigen (LPS) and CTB content of the vaccine samples determined at various times remained unchanged during the study except for the CTB component which decreased by about 50% after 6 months of storage at 42 C. Immunogenicity determined by immunization of rabbits with the vaccine in Freund's complete adjuvant and measuring anti-LPS and anti-CTB antibody titers in the serum by an ELISA was also found to be unaltered. Lyophilization of the vaccine and storage at room temperature for 7 days also did not have any adverse effect on antigen content or immunogenicity as tested above.
