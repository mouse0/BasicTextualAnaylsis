 3 position. P. gingivalis lipid A exhibited no or very low endotoxic activities,  i.e., lethal toxicity in galactosamine-loaded mice, preparative ability for local Shwartzman reaction, pyrogenicity and Limulus test as compared with compounds 506 and 516. However, polyclonal B-cell activation of BALB/c mouse splenocytes was as strong as that of compound 506. Furthermore, P. gingivalis lipid A had stronger immunoadjuvant and hemagglutinating activities than compound 506. The absence of  ester-linked phosphate at the 4' position and ester-linked fatty acids, and the presence and positions of fatty acids possessing considerable lengths of acyl chains are unique features of P. gingivalis lipid A, and they differentiate this  lipid A from enterobacterial and other lipids A. The good balance between
