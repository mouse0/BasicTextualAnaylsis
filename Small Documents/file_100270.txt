 chromotogenic substrates, both CAP7 peptides blocked the coagulation cascade at two sites, activation of factor X to Xa and conversion of Factor II (prothrombin) to factor IIa (thrombin). In vivo treatment of peptide #197 prevented acute lethality in mice injected with tissue factor (rabbit brain thromboplastin). Two  other peptides, #32(Gly1-Phe9) and #50(Ile13-Typ37) failed to demonstrate LPS-binding, LPS-neutralizing, antibacterial and anticoagulant activities. The active peptides but not the inactive peptide maintain a putative heparin binding  domain at their N-termini. This heparin binding domain is participate in the LPS-binding, LPS neutralizing, antibacterial and anticoagulant activities of CAP7. These active peptides may have a therapeutic potential for treatment for
