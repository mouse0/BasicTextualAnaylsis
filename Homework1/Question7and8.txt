7.  If that is meant to be in R, the = sign should be a <-.  Also, the fmeasure is ((B^2 + 1) * precision * 
recall) / (b^2 * precision) * recall.  The calcuations given (f.measure = 2* precision* recall) seem to be 
missing a few steps unless beta = 1 and this is merely calculating the numerator.

8. If all of the arguments (falseNegatives, falsePostivies, truePositives, trueNegatives) are 0, the program
will crash because you cannot divide by 0.  Also if any of the arguments are null or not numbers the program
will crash.
